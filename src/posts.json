As the title suggests, creating this website has been my first proper interaction with react and typescript, and while my current understanding of the two is growing, I would like to share one of the struggles I faced while developing this website: switching between screens.",
                "I'll admit, at first I thought that this was going to be a simple task of using the a (or link) tag, but I discovered that most react websites are single page applications: the content may change, but the url remains constant. This effect is typically acheived through conditional rendering, and, attempting to learn the community standards, I decided to do this as well.",
                "That said, my first attempt involved managing state in the App component and passing the updater function to the child nodes as a property (prop) if needed. I was certain this would be fine, but I was greeted by an error message upon testing app: I could not call the updater function from anywhere that wasn't the app node specifically. According to ^^Link, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65380054/how-to-return-a-value-from-a-component-in-react, this^^ helpful stack overflow post, data in react only flows in one direction: from parent to child, so I needed to find a different solution.",
                "^^Image, diagram1.jpg, How my First Attempt Functioned^^",
                "I initially assumed that calling a wrapper function that was in the App.tsx file in order to call the updater function managing the state in charge of the screens would not work. I figured the machine code would simplify down to equivilate my first attempted solution, thus resulting in an error. My next idea was to use a custom event and call the dispatch function in the child nodes as to trigger an event listener in the app node that would call the updater function and therefore switch screens.",
                "^^Image, diagram2.png, Second Attempt^^",
                "This ultimately worked and so I have decided upon keeping it, but I have heard that calling a seperate function to call the updater function does work (though I remain skeptical), which might be something to implement in the future. As of current projects, however, I am currently working on a random dungeon generator generator (an app to generate code that would generate a random dungeon), and you can expect an update soon on that.",

                "A quick update before the main point: I did some more research on how switching screens should work in react, and have now implemented what is hopefully the proper method of doing so. Now, I manage state for the current screen on the main App.tsx file and pass a wrapper function to the child nodes that calls the updater function for the state. Additionally, I have switched from storing the current screen as state to storing an object, making it easier to manage.

                "3. Reference array R just holds reference values to distances in D and lines in L. R should look like [0, 1, …, n] given an n sided polygon at the start. For the sake of simplicity, let P be a 3 sided polygon in this example. R would look like this: [0, 1, 2]. Due to the position of point z, let’s say D (the distances from point Z to each line) looks like this: [12, 24, 11]. The goal would be to sort R such that the reference values would point to the D values ascending in order. So R would now look like this: [2, 0, 1].",
                "4. Now, you should take the first element in R to reference the according line in L (so L[R[0]]). To find the closest point on this line to point z, the following formula can be applied: (B * B * z.x - C * A - z.y * B * A) / (B * B + A * A) = x, and y = (A * z.x + C) / B. Note that if B is zero then y will be undefined, to remedy this, just return z.y if B is equal to zero (Also, remember A, B, and C as variables to describe a line from earlier). Let (x, y) now comprise point p.",
                "5. Given point p from the previous step, we need to check if it actually falls between the two points that comprise the line on the polygon. To do this (because we already know the point falls on the line) we can just check if the point falls within the length of the line from both points that make the line. So, where p1 and p2 are the points that make the line of the polygon we are checking, distance d1 = distanceBetween(p1, p2), d2 = distanceBetween(p1, p), and d3 = distanceBetween(p2, p). The distance between function is just the pythagorean theorem: (p1, p2) -> (p1.x - p2.x) * (p1.x - p2.x) + (p1.y - p2.y) * (p1.y - p2.y). After performing this check, if the point falls between the two points, we now need to check if any of the vertices of the polygon are closer to mouse (to ensure that the point is going to be on the correct side of the polygon). To do this, just check the distance to each vertex of the polygon, if the distance to one of the points is less, return that point instead, otherwise return point p as the closest point to the reference point.",
                "6. If the check fails, however, simply remove R[0]. if R now has no more elements, proceed to step 7, otherwise go back to step 4.",
                "7. Simply apply the distance formula from before (distanceBetween), on every vertice of the polygon. Determine the closest point to your reference point z and return that point instead.",

                "^^PointOnPolygon^^",
                "You may notice that in the concave portion of the polygon that the point will jump quickly to the other line. My current theory as to why this happens is because as the mouse point gets projected onto the polygon, it becomes impossible to make the projected point closer to the concave vertex without another line taking priority. Thus, you have to move the mouse closer and closer to make the point approach the vertex. By this logic, at vertices that form an greater than 180 degree angle, the point will be 'swallowed' up by the other sides.",
